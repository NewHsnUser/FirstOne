# Surah Fatiha

>Other names: *Umm-al Quraan*, *Umm-al Kitaab*, *Al-Quraan Al-Azim*

## Intro:

### Important Points:

- The whole surah was not revealed at once
- This Surah is like the quintessence of Qura'an and the other surahs is the elaboration.
- This also acts as a Disclaimer before the recitation or study of Quraan, i.e, he should approach this book with a mind cleansed of all of his previous thoughts and opinions, seeking nothing but Truth and the right path. And the whole of the Quraan is the answer to this request.
-  The Surah begins with the praise of Him before whom the request is to be submitted, and ends with the request for guidance.
-  > **The prophet Muhammad (pbuh)** has said "I swear by Allah who is the master of my life, neither the Torah, nor the Evangile nor the Psalms of David have anything to compare with the Opening Chapter of the Quraan.
- > The Holy Prophet (pbuh) has also said that this Surah is a cure for all kinds of illnesses. According to another Hadith, the Surah has also been named the "Cure" (Al-Shifa).
