## **Bismillahi Ar-Rahman-Ur-Rahim**

# Surah Fatiha

>Other names: *Umm-al Quraan*, *Umm-al Kitaab*, *Al-Quraan Al-Azim*

## Intro:

### Important Points:

- The whole surah was not revealed at once
- Also this surah is revealed twice, once in Makkah and once in Madinah. This also shows how important this Surah is!
- This Surah is like the quintessence of Qura'an and the other surahs is the elaboration.
- This also acts as a Disclaimer before the recitation or study of Quraan, i.e, he should approach this book with a mind cleansed of all of his previous thoughts and opinions, seeking nothing but Truth and the right path. And the whole of the Quraan is the answer to this request.
-  The Surah begins with the praise of Him before whom the request is to be submitted, and ends with the request for guidance.
-  > **The prophet Muhammad (pbuh)** has said "I swear by Allah who is the master of my life, neither the Torah, nor the Evangile nor the Psalms of David have anything to compare with the Opening Chapter of the Quraan.
- > The Holy Prophet (pbuh) has also said that this Surah is a cure for all kinds of illnesses. According to another Hadith, the Surah has also been named the "Cure" (Al-Shifa).

  ### **Bismillah:**
  



## **STRAIGHT PATH**
Meaning the path with no twists and turns and path of faith which equally avoids the two extremes of **excess and deficiency**.Also, the path is very clear, evident, wide, foulproof.
- The last 2 verses will define and identify that "staright path".
  
  > "**The path of those on whom You have bestowed Your grace.**"

  Those are:
  - >"**Those whom Allah has blessed, namely, the prophets, the Siddiqin, the Shuhada, and the righteous**" (4:69)

  Among these four:
  1. The Prophets are the greatest.
  2. The Siddiqin are those who have acquired spiritual perfection, and thus attain the highest rank among the followers of the prophets.
  3. The Shuhada (martyrs) are those who sacrifice even their lives for the sake of their faith
  4. The righteous are those who follow the Shari'ah completely, not only in the matter of obligations but also with regard to commendable actions. In everyday language they are called the pious or the virtuous or the good.
  - This verse determines the straight path in a positive manner.

  > "**Not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.**"

  - Those who have incurred Allah's wrath are those people who inspite of being quite familiar with the commandments of Allah wilfully go against them out of a calculated perversity or in the service of their desires. For example: The Jews.
  - As for the people who have gone "astray", they are the people who, out of ignorance or lack of thought, go beyond the limits appointed by Allah, and indulge in excess and exaggeration in religious matters. For example: The Christians.
  - On the one hand, there is the rebelliousness of the Jews who not only refused to listen to the prophets of Allah but went on to kill them; on the other hand, there is the excessive zeal of the Christians who deified a prophet.
  - In short, the prayer for the straight path is the essence of this Surah.
 
  ### The Key to the Straight path

- The Quraan is an explanation of the Straight path and the teachings of Muhammad (pbuh) is an elaboration.
- One cannot improvise his faith ny just studying the Quraan, had a book by itself been sufficient for the guidance of man, there was no need for the prophets to be sent.
- One cannot solely rely on one's own study and judgment, but must turn to someone who knows.

- ## Conclusion:

- To recapitulate, the SGrah Al-Fatihah begins with the praise of Allah. Then comes an affirmation on the part of man that he worships Allah alone, and turns to him alone in the hour of need. That is, so to say, the oath of allegiance man offers to his Lord and Master. Finally, there is a prayer which covers all possible human needs and goals.

- The proper way of praying to Allah:
   - One should begin by fulfilling one's obligation to praise Allah, then he should offer the pledge of complete allegiance to Allah to the effect that one does not regard anyone except Allah as being worthy of *adoration and worship*, nor does one look upon anyone except Allah as having the real power to give help in one's distress or need.
   - Finally one should pray for what he wishes to have, and that there is every hope that a prayer made in this manner will be granted.
   - Also, while praying, one should be so comprehensive that it includes all possible human goals, eg: Praying for the Straight path.
